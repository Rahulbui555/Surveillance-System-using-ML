A good data set plays an important core role in the development of the proposed surveillance system. A machine learning model for the detection will be trained by giving them image frames from the developed data set. In the next phase, necessary preprocessing steps are applied to the image frames.
Developed an Automated Monitoring System using Python, to implement a Surveillance System utilizing Machine Learning for motion detection and monitoring.This system check to analyze live Motion feeds,and generate real-time alerts for security personnel.
